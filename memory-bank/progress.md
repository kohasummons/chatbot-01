# Progress Log

## Step 1: Set Up SuperBase Database (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Installed Supabase client library: `@supabase/supabase-js`
   - Created a Supabase client utility file for database connectivity (`lib/supabase.ts`)

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Created complete database schema with the following tables:
     - `patients`: For storing patient information (id, name, email, phone)
     - `dentists`: For storing dentist information (id, name, specialization)
     - `appointments`: For storing appointment data (id, patient_id, dentist_id, date, time, status)
   - Created SQL scripts to initialize the database (`lib/database-setup.sql`)
   - Added SQL commands to insert test data (Dr. Smith and test appointments)

3. **Database Functions**:
   - Implemented the `check_availability` function to return available time slots for a given date
   - Added placeholder functions for upcoming steps:
     - `book_appointment` (to be implemented in Step 4)
     - `reschedule_appointment` (to be implemented in Step 5)
   - Created a test function to verify database connectivity

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created a comprehensive database setup guide (`docs/database-setup-guide.md`) with step-by-step instructions
   - Updated the project README.md with setup instructions and implementation status

5. **API Testing**:
   - Added a test API route (`/api/test-db`) to verify database connectivity
   - Set up proper error handling for database operations

## Step 3: Implement Backend Function - Check Availability (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Check Availability Function**:
   - Verified the implementation of the `check_availability` function in `lib/appointmentFunctions.ts`
   - The function generates all possible time slots from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM in 30-minute intervals
   - It queries the Appointments table to get booked slots for a specific date and dentist
   - It returns an array of available slots (all slots minus booked ones)

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created an API route `/api/check-availability/route.ts` to test the availability function
   - Created an API route `/api/insert-test-appointments/route.ts` to insert test appointment data
   - Set up test for two appointments on "2023-11-01" at "09:00" and "10:00"

3. **Testing**:
   - Verified the `check_availability` function works correctly by:
     - Ensuring test appointments exist for "2023-11-01" at "09:00" and "10:00"
     - Confirming the function correctly excludes these slots from available times
     - Validating that other time slots like "09:30" and "10:30" are included in the results

### Next Steps:

(Step 4)

## Step 4: Implement Backend Function - Book Appointment (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Book Appointment Function**:
   - Implemented the `book_appointment` function in `lib/appointmentFunctions.ts`
   - The function takes parameters: `patient_name`, `date`, `time`, and optional `dentist_id`
   - It performs the following actions:
     - Checks if the requested slot is available using the `check_availability` function
     - Verifies if the patient already exists in the database
     - Creates a new patient record if the patient does not exist
     - Books the appointment by inserting a new record in the Appointments table
     - Returns appropriate success or failure messages

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created an API route `/api/book-appointment/route.ts` to test the booking function
   - The API accepts URL parameters: `patient_name`, `date`, `time`, and `dentist_id`
   - Default values are provided for testing: "Jane Doe", "2023-11-01", "11:00"

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling for all database operations
   - Each step of the booking process has specific error messages
   - The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes for success and failure cases

### Next Steps:

(Step 5: Implement Backend Function - Reschedule Appointment)
