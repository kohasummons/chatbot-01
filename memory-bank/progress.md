# Progress Log

## Step 1: Set Up SuperBase Database (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Installed Supabase client library: `@supabase/supabase-js`
   - Created a Supabase client utility file for database connectivity (`lib/supabase.ts`)

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Created complete database schema with the following tables:
     - `patients`: For storing patient information (id, name, email, phone)
     - `dentists`: For storing dentist information (id, name, specialization)
     - `appointments`: For storing appointment data (id, patient_id, dentist_id, date, time, status)
   - Created SQL scripts to initialize the database (`lib/database-setup.sql`)
   - Added SQL commands to insert test data (Dr. Smith and test appointments)

3. **Database Functions**:
   - Implemented the `check_availability` function to return available time slots for a given date
   - Added placeholder functions for upcoming steps:
     - `book_appointment` (to be implemented in Step 4)
     - `reschedule_appointment` (to be implemented in Step 5)
   - Created a test function to verify database connectivity

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created a comprehensive database setup guide (`docs/database-setup-guide.md`) with step-by-step instructions
   - Updated the project README.md with setup instructions and implementation status

5. **API Testing**:
   - Added a test API route (`/api/test-db`) to verify database connectivity
   - Set up proper error handling for database operations

## Step 3: Implement Backend Function - Check Availability (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Check Availability Function**:
   - Verified the implementation of the `check_availability` function in `lib/appointmentFunctions.ts`
   - The function generates all possible time slots from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM in 30-minute intervals
   - It queries the Appointments table to get booked slots for a specific date and dentist
   - It returns an array of available slots (all slots minus booked ones)

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created an API route `/api/check-availability/route.ts` to test the availability function
   - Created an API route `/api/insert-test-appointments/route.ts` to insert test appointment data
   - Set up test for two appointments on "2023-11-01" at "09:00" and "10:00"

3. **Testing**:
   - Verified the `check_availability` function works correctly by:
     - Ensuring test appointments exist for "2023-11-01" at "09:00" and "10:00"
     - Confirming the function correctly excludes these slots from available times
     - Validating that other time slots like "09:30" and "10:30" are included in the results

### Next Steps:

(Step 4)

## Step 4: Implement Backend Function - Book Appointment (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Book Appointment Function**:
   - Implemented the `book_appointment` function in `lib/appointmentFunctions.ts`
   - The function takes parameters: `patient_name`, `date`, `time`, and optional `dentist_id`
   - It performs the following actions:
     - Checks if the requested slot is available using the `check_availability` function
     - Verifies if the patient already exists in the database
     - Creates a new patient record if the patient does not exist
     - Books the appointment by inserting a new record in the Appointments table
     - Returns appropriate success or failure messages

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created an API route `/api/book-appointment/route.ts` to test the booking function
   - The API accepts URL parameters: `patient_name`, `date`, `time`, and `dentist_id`
   - Default values are provided for testing: "Jane Doe", "2023-11-01", "11:00"

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling for all database operations
   - Each step of the booking process has specific error messages
   - The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes for success and failure cases

### Next Steps:

(Step 5: Implement Backend Function - Reschedule Appointment)

## Step 5: Implement Backend Function - Reschedule Appointment (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Reschedule Appointment Function**:
   - Implemented the `reschedule_appointment` function in `lib/appointmentFunctions.ts`
   - The function takes parameters: `patient_name`, `original_date`, `original_time`, `new_date`, `new_time`, optional `dentist_id`, and optional `patient_email`
   - It performs the following actions:
     - Finds the patient's ID using the provided name and email (if provided)
     - Queries the Appointments table to find a matching appointment based on patient_id, date, time, and dentist_id
     - Checks if the new slot is available using the `check_availability` function
     - Updates the appointment record with the new date and time if available
     - Returns appropriate success or failure messages

2. **Enhanced Patient Identification**:
   - Updated both `book_appointment` and `reschedule_appointment` to use email as an additional identifier
   - Modified API endpoints to accept and pass email parameters
   - Improved error messages to specify whether lookup failed by name or name+email
   - Preserved backward compatibility by making email parameter optional

3. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created an API route `/api/reschedule-appointment/route.ts` to test the rescheduling function
   - The API accepts URL parameters: `patient_name`, `patient_email`, `original_date`, `original_time`, `new_date`, `new_time`, and `dentist_id`
   - Default values are provided for testing: "Jane Doe", "2023-11-01", "11:00" to "2023-11-01", "12:00"

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling for all database operations
   - Each step of the rescheduling process has specific error messages
   - The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes for success and failure cases

5. **Testing**:
   - Verified the `reschedule_appointment` function works correctly by:
     - Successfully rescheduling an existing appointment from "11:00" to "13:00" using both name and email
     - Confirming the API returns appropriate success messages
   - Tested error scenarios including:
     - Patient not found with provided name and email
     - Appointment not found
     - New slot not available
     - Ambiguous appointment matches

### Next Steps:

(Step 6: Integrate AI with Function Calling)

## Step 6: Integrate AI with Function Calling (Completed)

Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **AI SDK Integration**:
   - Installed AI SDK packages: `ai`, `@ai-sdk/react`, and `@ai-sdk/openai`
   - Created an API route handler at `app/api/chat/route.ts` for handling chat requests
   - Implemented function calling using the AI SDK's `tool` function

2. **Function Calling**:
   - Defined Zod schemas for all three appointment functions:
     - `check_availability`: For checking available appointment slots
     - `book_appointment`: For booking new appointments
     - `reschedule_appointment`: For rescheduling existing appointments
   - Connected these functions to the OpenAI model through the AI SDK
   - Enabled multi-step tool calls with proper error handling

3. **Chat Interface**:
   - Created a responsive chat UI with a floating chat button
   - Implemented a modal chat interface with message history
   - Added support for displaying different message types
   - Included loading states and animations for better UX
   - Used the useChat hook from AI SDK for managing chat state

4. **Testing**:
   - Verified function calling works correctly with test scenarios
   - Tested the chat interface with different appointment-related queries
   - Confirmed multi-step function calls work properly with `maxSteps: 5`
