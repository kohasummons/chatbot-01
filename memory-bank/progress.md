Date: Current Date

### Achievements:

1. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Installed Supabase client library: `@supabase/supabase-js`
   - Created a Supabase client utility file for database connectivity (`lib/supabase.ts`)

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Created complete database schema with the following tables:
     - `patients`: For storing patient information (id, name, email, phone)
     - `dentists`: For storing dentist information (id, name, specialization)
     - `appointments`: For storing appointment data (id, patient_id, dentist_id, date, time, status)
   - Created SQL scripts to initialize the database (`lib/database-setup.sql`)
   - Added SQL commands to insert test data (Dr. Smith and test appointments)

3. **Database Functions**:
   - Implemented the `check_availability` function to return available time slots for a given date
   - Added placeholder functions for upcoming steps:
     - `book_appointment` (to be implemented in Step 4)
     - `reschedule_appointment` (to be implemented in Step 5)
   - Created a test function to verify database connectivity

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created a comprehensive database setup guide (`docs/database-setup-guide.md`) with step-by-step instructions
   - Updated the project README.md with setup instructions and implementation status

5. **API Testing**:
   - Added a test API route (`/api/test-db`) to verify database connectivity
   - Set up proper error handling for database operations

### Next Steps:

The next step (Step 2) will focus on initializing the Next.js project with all required dependencies and configurations for the dental chatbot frontend and backend components.
